Genetic Shakespeare Algorithm
=============================

A simple genetic algorithm that tries to learn how to write Shakespeare's "To be or not to be" sonnet.

This is a first-attempt at writing a genetic algorithm, the idea was inspired by [The Code Train's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) series on genetic algorithms.
